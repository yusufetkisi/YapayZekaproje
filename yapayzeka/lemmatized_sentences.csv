python programming language
design philosophy emphasizes code readability use significant indentation
python dynamically
support multiple programming paradigm including structured particularly procedural functional programming
often described battery included language due comprehensive standard library
guido van rossum began working python late successor abc programming language first released python
python released
python released major revision completely earlier version
python released last release python
python consistently rank one popular programming language gained widespread use machine learning community
history python conceived late guido van rossum centrum wiskunde informatica cwi netherlands conceived successor abc programming language inspired setl capable exception handling interfacing amoeba operating system
python implementation began december
van rossum assumed sole responsibility project lead developer july announced permanent vacation responsibility python benevolent dictator life bdfl title bestowed python community reflect commitment project chief
since come retirement
january active python core developer elected steering council lead project
name python said derive british comedy series monty python flying circus
python released october many major new feature list comprehension garbage collection reference counting unicode support
python initially set postponed concern large body existing code could easily python
longer receives security patch update
python older version officially unsupported different unofficial python implementation pypy continues support python plus plus signifying least backported security update
python released december new semantics changed syntax
least every python release since unsupported added syntax language later release removed outdated module changed semantics least minor way
april python latest stable release highly recommended upgrade upgrade older release
version currently receives full security update python october active support april since security fix
python oldest supported version python albeit support phase python become product
starting python later version receive two year full support increased one half year followed three year security support total duration support previously
security update expedited twice
issue fixed september python version version including insecure issue leading possible remote code execution poisoning
python added union type operator match case keywords structural pattern matching statement
python expanded exception handling functionality
python added new keyword type
notable change version include increased program execution speed improved error reporting
python claimed faster python python increase additional
python also includes improved error message improved many change
python introduces syntax type new improved interactive interpreter repl featuring editing color support incremental garbage collector result shorter pause collection program many object well increasing improved speed experimental jit compiler feature enabled specifically increase speed experimental build mode disables global interpreter lock gil allowing thread run concurrently enabled
python introduces change behavior new semantics fixing bug removing many deprecated class function method well api outdated module
old implementation local slow inconsistent buggy many corner case oddity
code work around may need revising code us local simple templating print debugging continue work correctly
python introduces experimental build mode disables global interpreter lock gil gil feature cpython previously prevented multiple thread executing python bytecode simultaneously
optional build introduced pep enables better exploitation cpu
allowing multiple thread run python code parallel mode address performance bottleneck associated gil
change offer new path parallelism python without resorting multiprocessing external concurrency framework
additional module removed python many deprecated class function method
python add sigstore digital verification signature cpython artifact addition pgp
use pgp criticized security practitioner python transitioning sigstore exclusively dropping pgp
python removed wstr meaning python extension need modified added pattern matching language
python dropped outdated module dropped future deprecated already deprecated array u format code emit deprecationwarning since removed python
w format code used instead
part ctypes also deprecated emit deprecationwarning removed
using code already high potential security functionality bug
part typing module deprecated
creating class using keyword argument denote field disallowed python
python alpha phase
regard possible change annotation python import annotation continue work converting annotation string
python enhancement proposal pep proposes standard format distributing python binary
python make mode default mode supported current python version currently must opted
already used default window operating system purpose exception opening file
enabling also make code fully
design philosophy feature python programming language
programming structured programming fully supported many feature support functional programming programming including metaprogramming metaobjects
many paradigm supported via extension including design contract logic programming
python often referred language seamlessly integrate component written language
python us dynamic typing combination reference counting garbage collector memory management
us dynamic name resolution late binding bind method variable name program execution
python design offer support functional programming lisp tradition
filter mapandreduce function list comprehension dictionary set generator expression
standard library two module itertools functools implement functional tool borrowed haskell standard ml
python core philosophy summarized zen python pep includes aphorism beautiful better ugly
explicit better implicit
simple better complex
complex better complicated
readability count
however python feature regularly violate principle received criticism adding unnecessary language bloat
response criticism note zen python guideline rather rule
addition new feature controversial guido van rossum resigned benevolent dictator life conflict adding assignment expression operator python
nevertheless rather building functionality core python designed highly extensible via module
compact modularity made particularly popular mean adding programmable interface existing application
van rossum vision small core language large standard library easily extensible interpreter stemmed frustration abc represented opposite approach
python claim strive simpler syntax grammar giving developer choice coding methodology
contrast perl motto one way python advocate approach preferably way
practice however python provides many way achieve given goal
example least three way format string literal certainty one programmer use
alex martelli fellow python software foundation python book author wrote describe something considered compliment python culture
python developer usually try avoid premature optimization also reject patch part cpython reference implementation would offer marginal increase speed cost clarity
execution speed improved moving function extension module written language c using compiler like pypy
also possible language approach either fails achieve expected since python dynamic language restricted subset python compiled potential minor semantic change
python developer aim language fun use
goal reflected tribute british comedy group monty playful approach tutorial reference material
instance code example use term spam egg reference monty python sketch rather typical term foo bar
common neologism python community pythonic wide range meaning related program style
pythonic code may use python idiom well natural show fluency language conform python minimalist philosophy emphasis readability
syntax semantics python meant easily readable language
formatting visually uncluttered often us english keywords language use punctuation
unlike many language use curly bracket delimit block semicolon statement allowed rarely used
fewer syntactic exception special case c pascal
indentation python us whitespace indentation rather curly bracket keywords delimit block
increase indentation come certain statement decrease indentation signifies end current block
thus program visual structure accurately represents semantic structure
feature sometimes termed rule
language use indentation way indentation semantic meaning
recommended indent size four space
statement control flow python statement include following assignment statement using single equal sign statement conditionally executes block code along else elif contraction else statement iterates iterable object capturing element local variable use attached block statement executes block code long condition true try statement allows exception raised attached code block caught handled except clause new syntax except python exception group try statement also ensures code finally block always run regardless block exit raise statement used raise specified exception caught exception class statement executes block code attache local namespace class use programming def statement defines function method statement encloses code block within context manager allowing raii behavior replacing common idiom example context include acquiring lock code run releasing lock opening closing file break statement exit loop continue statement skip rest current iteration continues next del statement remove reference name value producing error variable referred redefined pas statement serving nop operation syntactically needed create empty code block assert statement used debugging check condition apply yield statement return value generator function also operator used implement coroutines return statement used return value function import statement used import module whose function variable used current program match case statement analogous switch statement construct compare expression one case measure
assignment statement bind name reference separate dynamically allocated object
variable may subsequently rebound time object
python variable name generic reference holder without fixed data type however always refers object type
called dynamic contrast language variable may contain value certain type
python support tail call optimization continuation according van rossum language never
however better support functionality provided extending python generator
generator lazy iterators data passed unidirectionally generator
python possible pas data back generator function version data passed multiple stack level
expression python expression include following operator mathematical addition subtraction multiplication similar language behavior division differs
two type division python floor division integer division division
python us operator exponentiation
python us operator string concatenation
language us operator duplicating string specified number time
infix operator intended used library numpy matrix multiplication
syntax called walrus operator introduced python
operator assigns value variable part larger expression
python compare two object value
python operator may used compare object identity comparison reference comparison may example b python us boolean operator
python type expression called list comprehension general expression called generator expression
anonymous function implemented using lambda expression however may one expression body
conditional expression written x c else
different operand order c
x operator common many language
python make distinction list tuples
list written mutable used key dictionary since dictionary key must immutable python
tuples written immutable thus used key dictionary provided tuple element immutable
operator used concatenate two tuples directly modify content produce new tuple containing element
example given variable initially equal executing first evaluates yield result assigned back effectively modifying content conforming immutable nature tuple object
parenthesis optional tuples unambiguous context
python feature sequence unpacking multiple expression evaluating something assignable variable writable property associated forming tuple literal whole result put side equal sign assignment statement
statement expects iterable object side equal sign produce number value writable expression side iterating statement assigns value produced right corresponding expression left
python string format operator function analogously printf format string c
blah evaluates
python operator supplemented format method str class blah
python added spam blah egg spam egg
string python concatenated adding using operator adding integer float spam egg return spameggs
string contain number concatenated string rather integer
return
python support string literal several way delimited single double quotation mark single double quotation mark equivalent functionality unlike unix shell perl language
mark use backslash escape character
string interpolation became available python formatted string literal
starting ending three single double quotation mark may span multiple line function like document shell perl ruby
raw string variety denoted prefixing string literal escape sequence interpreted hence raw string useful literal backslashes common regular expression path
compare c
python array index array slicing expression list written key start stop start stop step
index negative index relative end
slice take element start index including stop index
optional third slice parameter called step stride allows element skipped reversed
slice index may example return copy entire list
element slice shallow copy
python distinction expression statement rigidly enforced contrast language common lisp scheme ruby
distinction lead duplicating functionality example list comprehension conditional expression block eval exec function python exec statement former function expression latter statement statement part expression restriction expression list dict comprehension lambda expression contain statement
particular case assignment statement part conditional expression conditional statement
method method object function attached object class syntax normal method function argument syntactic sugar instance argument
python method explicit self parameter access instance data contrast implicit self parameter programming language java ruby
python also provides method often called dunder method name begin end double underscore method allow class modify handled native operation including length comparison arithmetic type conversion
typing python us duck typing typed object untyped variable name
type constraint checked definition time rather operation object may fail usage time indicating object appropriate type
despite dynamically typed python strongly typed forbidding operation poorly defined adding number string rather quietly attempting interpret
python allows programmer define type using class often programming
new instance class constructed calling class example spamclass eggsclass class instance metaclass type instance thereby allowing metaprogramming reflection
version python two kind class using syntax
current python version support semantics new style
python support optional type annotation
annotation enforced language may used external tool mypy catch error
mypy also support python compiler called mypyc leverage type annotation optimization
arithmetic operation python includes conventional symbol arithmetic operator operator modulo operator
module operator remainder negative
python also offer symbol exponentiation
also offer operator
operator work traditional mathematics precedence rule infix operator also unary represent positive negative number respectively
division integer produce result
behavior division changed significantly time current version python since changed operator always represent division
floor division operator introduced
thus
adding import division statement cause module python use python rule division instead see
python term operator represents true division simply division operator represents floor division
version operator represents classic division
rounding towards negative infinity though different method language add consistency python
instance rounding implies equation b always true
rounding also implies equation b b valid positive negative value
expected result b lie interval b b positive integer however maintaining validity equation requires result must lie interval b b negative
python provides round function rounding float nearest integer
python us round even method round round produce
python version used method round round
python allows boolean expression contain multiple equality relation consistent general usage mathematics
example expression b c test whether less b b less language interpret expression differently c expression would first evaluate b resulting result would compared python us arithmetic integer operation
decimal decimal module provides decimal number arbitrary precision several rounding mode
fraction class fraction module provides arbitrary precision rational number
due python extensive mathematics library library numpy language frequently used scientific scripting task numerical data processing manipulation
function syntax function created python using def keyword
function defined similarly called first providing function name required parameter
example function print input assign default value function parameter case actual value provided run time syntax used inside function header
code example hello world
program program calculate factorial positive integer library python large standard library commonly cited one greatest strength
application many standard format protocol mime http supported
language includes module creating graphical user interface connecting relational database generating pseudorandom number arithmetic decimal manipulating regular expression unit testing
part standard library covered example web server gateway interface wsgi implementation wsgiref follows pep part specified code internal documentation test suite
however standard library python code module must altered rewritten variant implementation
march python package index pypi official repository python software contains package
